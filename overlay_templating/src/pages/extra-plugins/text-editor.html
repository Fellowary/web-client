  <h5>William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616)</h5>
  Was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English
  language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet, and
  the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays,
  154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His
  plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than
  those of any other playwright
