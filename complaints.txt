I HATE THIS I HATE THIS I HATE THIS.
Why can't I make this design better?
Why is using cassandra so slow but faster than everything else?
why the fuck am I using up my life like this?
AAAAAAAAAHHH
FUCKING GOD DAMMIT
THIS ASYNC SHIT IS TURNING INTO SPAGHETTI CODE.  I NEED FLOW CHARTS FOR MY OWN DAMNED DESIGN.
WHY CAN'T I FIT THIS ALL IN MY HEAD.
I'M TIRED OF THIS SHIT.
THIS IS THE LAST STEP BUT IT TAKES SO LONG TO GET DONE.
FUCK
HANDLE MESSAGE, PARSE MESSAGE, DO SOME STUFF, REPLY TO MESSAGE, CLEAN UP.  WHY IS THIS SO HARD???
THE CAFFEINE ISN'T DOING ANYTHING ANYMORE.
WHY IS NO ONE HELPING?
I don't need anything.  I must code.
