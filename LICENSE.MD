Please read this Agreement carefully. It is a legal document that explains your rights and obligations related to your use of the Fellowary® Platform and related content. By downloading or using this software or any related content, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, please do not download or use this software or any related content.

Certain words or phrases are defined to have certain meanings when used in this Agreement. Those words and phrases are defined below in Section 23.

1. License Grant

Fellowary grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as described in this Agreement) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify the Licensed Technology for any lawful purpose (the “License”). However, the rights that Fellowary grants you under the License are subject to the terms of this Agreement, and you may only make use of the License if you comply with all applicable terms. Fellowary reserves all rights not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.

The License becomes effective on the date you accept this Agreement or download the Platform Code or any Content. The License does not grant you any title or ownership in the Licensed Technology.

(A) Allowed forms of Distribution and Sublicensing

You may Distribute Products or the Licensed Technology as follows:

a. Non-Platform Products - You may Distribute Non-Platform Products to any third party. “Non-Platform Product” means a Product made using the Licensed Technology that does not include any Platform Code or any Paid Content that does not require any Platform Code (including as modified by you under the License) to run. For example, and subject to the foregoing, you may freely Distribute non-interactive linear media products (e.g., broadcast or streamed video files, cartoons, movies, or images) rendered using the Platform Code, and asset files (other than Fellowary-Only Content) developed or used with the Platform Code, including in products that use or rely on third party software libraries. For clarity, this section does not constitute a license under any patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

b. Distribution to end users - You may Distribute the Licensed Technology incorporated in Source Code or Altered Code format only as an inseparable part of a Product to end users who are subject to an end user license agreement which explicitly disclaims any representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the Licensed Technology. The Product may not contain any Paid Content Distributed in source format or any Platform Tools.

c. Distribution to other licensees - You may Distribute Platform Code (including as modified by you under the License) in Source Code or Altered Code format, or any Content, to an Platform Licensee who has rights under its license to the same Version of the Platform Code or Content that you are Distributing.

Any public Distribution (i.e., intended for Platform Licensees generally) which includes Platform Tools (including as modified by you under the License) must take place through a fork of Fellowary’s GitHub Network (e.g., for distributing source code).

d. Distributions to employees and contractors - You also may Distribute Content (other than Paid Plug-ins) to an Platform Licensee who is your employee or your contractor who does not have rights under their license to the same Content, but only to permit that Platform Licensee to utilize that Content in good faith to develop a Product on your behalf for Distribution by you under the License, and not for the purpose of Content pooling or any other Distribution or sublicensing of Content that is not permitted under this Agreement. Recipients of such a Distribution have a limited license to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify that Content to develop your Product as outlined above, and for no other purpose.

e. Distribution of Non-ECMAScript Programming Language Integration - You may Distribute an integration of a programming language other than ECMAScript for the Licensed Technology, but if you do, the integration must be Distributed free of charge to all Platform Licensees, must be available in source code form (including, but not limited to, any compiler, linker, toolchain, and runtime), and must permit Distribution free of charge, on all platforms, in any Product.

You are permitted to post snippets of Platform Code, up to 300 lines of code in length, online in public forums for the sole purpose of discussing the content of the snippet, or distribute such snippets in connection with supporting patches and plug-ins for the Licensed Technology, so long as it is not for the purpose of enabling non-Platform Licensees to use or modify any Platform Code, or to aggregate, recombine, or reconstruct any larger portion of the Platform Code.

You may not sublicense the Licensed Technology in Source Code format. You may not sublicense the Licensed Technology in Altered Code format, or any Content, except to grant end users the ability to use, or to permit your publishers and distributors to market and Distribute, a Product that you Distribute as permitted in Section 1(a) above.

When you generate revenue from a Product or Distribute it to end users, you must provide Fellowary with advance notification at info@fellowary.com, as early as reasonably possible, including the name of the Product, the format of distribution, unique Product id (where applicable), and the distribution channel(s). However, no advance notice is required for Distribution of Non-Platform Products.

(B) Other Restrictions

(i) FP-Only Content

For FP-Only Content, you may exercise your rights under the License only if and to the extent that the FP-Only Content is utilized in a Product that requires the Platform Code to operate or is a non-interactive linear media product (e.g., broadcast or streamed video files, cartoons, movies, or images) rendered using the Platform Code. All references in this paragraph to FP-Only Content include modified versions thereof made by you under the License.

(ii) Non-Compatible Licenses

You may not combine, Distribute, or otherwise use the Licensed Technology with any code or other content which is covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the Licensed Technology be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement (“Non-Compatible License”). Code or content under the following licenses, for example, are prohibited: GNU General Public License (GPL), Lesser GPL (LGPL) (unless you are merely dynamically linking a shared library), or Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License. Code or content under the following licenses, for example, are allowed: BSD License, MIT License, Microsoft Public License, or Apache License. You may not sublicense the Licensed Technology under a Non-Compatible License.

(iii) General Restrictions

You may not engage in any activity with respect to the Licensed Technology, including as incorporated into a Product, (1) that violates any applicable law or regulation; (2) that results in the Licensed Technology being rented or leased; (3) that misappropriates any of Fellowary’s other products or services; (4) for the purpose of supporting a claim by you or any third party that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent; or (5) that results in a Distribution of a Product or the Licensed Technology in any manner other than what is permitted by Section 1(A). You also may not sell or grant a security interest in the Licensed Technology.

2. User License

The Licensed Technology is licensed to you for use by a single User. The User may store the Licensed Technology on any of the User’s computers, but the Licensed Technology cannot be shared with others (including any other employees or agents) except through a permitted Distribution as described above.

Under the License, the User may use the Licensed Technology for as long as you comply with this Agreement. If you are a legal entity, references to “you” in this agreement also apply to the User in all cases. You are responsible for the User’s compliance with this Agreement.

If you are an Academic Institution, your use is not limited to a single User for any Licensed Technology other than Paid Content. Instead, you may store that Licensed Technology on any of your computers, and you may allow all users of those computers to use that Licensed Technology under the License. However, those users are not authorized under your License to Distribute or sublicense the Licensed Technology (including as incorporated in a Product). For that, they must obtain a License of their own.

3. New Versions and Content

During the term of your License, you will be entitled to access future Versions of the Platform Code and new Content that Fellowary chooses to make available to you. Fellowary does not have any obligation to make new Versions of the Platform Code or new Content available. Nor does Fellowary have any obligation to continue to make available for access or download any or all Versions of the Platform Code or Content. However, any Versions of the Platform Code and Content that Fellowary has made available to you, and for which you have accepted any applicable amendment to this Agreement as described in Section 20, are considered part of the Licensed Technology and may be used under the License (as amended by that amendment).

4. Paid Content

Fellowary may make Paid Content available to you for a fee. Your License to Paid Content is subject to your payment of the associated fee. In addition, your Paid Plug-in Users’ use of any Paid Plug-in under the License is subject to your payment of the associated fee for each Paid Plug-in User for that Paid Plug-in. When you pay the fee to obtain Paid Content, you are purchasing from Fellowary the right to have your License include that Paid Content. Regardless of any references Fellowary may make outside this Agreement to purchasing or selling Paid Content, Paid Content is licensed, not sold, to you under the License.

When you provide payment information to Fellowary or its authorized processor, you represent that you are an authorized user of the payment card, PIN, key, account, or other payment method specified by you, and you authorize Fellowary to charge such payment method for the full amount of the transaction.

From time to time, Fellowary may display links to Third Party Licensor Content. Fellowary does not license or provide Third Party Licensor Content to you under this Agreement. Any use of Third Party Licensor Content requires you to enter into a separate license agreement directly with the provider of the Third Party Licensor Content. The terms of your license agreement with the provider of the Third Party Licensor Content will govern all matters related to your use of Third Party Licensor Content rather than the terms of this Agreement.

5. Royalty

You agree to pay Fellowary a royalty equal to 1.5% of all worldwide gross revenue actually attributable to each Product, regardless of whether that revenue is received by you or any other person or legal entity, as follows:

a. Gross revenue resulting from any and all sales of a Product to end users through any and all media, including but not limited to digital and retail;
b. Gross revenue resulting from any and all in-app purchases, downloadable content, microtransactions, subscriptions, sale, transfer, or exchange of content created by end users for use with a Product, or redemption of virtual currency, either within a Product or made externally but which directly affect the operation of the Product;
c. Gross revenue from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign which is directly associated with Product access or in-Product benefit (e.g., in a multi-tiered campaign, if an amount is established in an early tier solely for Product access, your royalty obligation will apply to that amount for each backer with the same access, but not on additional amounts in higher tiers based on ancillary benefits);
d. Your revenue from in-app advertising and affiliate programs;
e. Revenue from advance payments for a Product (from a publisher or otherwise);
f. Revenue received in connection with a Product’s inclusion in a streaming, subscription, or other app-delivery service, including without limitation development funds and bonuses; and
g. Revenue in any other form actually attributable to a Product (unless excluded below).

However, no royalty is owed on the following forms of revenue:

1. The first $1,000,000 in lifetime gross revenue for each Product;
2. Gross revenue attributable to a Product from a calendar quarter during which the gross revenue for such Product is less than $10,000;
3. Consulting fees or work-for-hire fees which are non-recoupable for services performed using the Licensed Technology (e.g., an architect-created walkthrough simulation or a contractor-developed in-house training simulator);
4. Revenue from a Non-Platform Product;
5. Revenue from a Product which is only Distributed to Platform Licensees;
6. Revenue from ancillary products which are not software and which do not contain embedded information (such as QR codes) which affects the operation of the Product (e.g., comic books, soundtracks, apparel);
7. Revenue from donations for a Product which are not tied to Product access or in-Product benefits;
8. Revenue collected from an end-user buyer of in-app items or other in-app content for your Product which is sold by an end-user seller and which is actually paid to the end-user seller and is not retained by you or any other party.

The royalty is based on gross revenue from end users, regardless of whether you sell your Product to end users directly, self-publish via the App Store or any similar store, or work with a publisher. The following simplified example illustrates the application of the royalty to gross sales: if your Product earns $10 on the App Store, Apple may pay you $7 (having deducted 30% as a distribution fee), but your royalty to Fellowary would still be 1.5% of $10 (or $0.15).

Royalties that you pay on an advance payment of revenue for a Product that is recoupable by the payer, such as a publisher, may be credited against future royalty payments that you incur under this Agreement for that Product.

Royalties must be reported and paid on a per-Product basis. Royalty exemptions may not be aggregated across multiple Products.

Within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter in which a Product earns revenue outside of the above-listed royalty exclusions, you must pay to Fellowary the full amount of the royalty due for that quarter and send Fellowary a royalty report on a per Product basis. Detailed information on royalty reporting and payment can be found by contacting info@fellowary.com.

The royalty will be payable under this Agreement with respect to each Product for as long as any Platform Code or Content (including as modified by you under the License) incorporated in or used to make the Product are protected under copyright or other applicable intellectual property law.

6. Payments

Fellowary reserves the right to charge a 2% late fee, per calendar quarter (compounding), for any amounts unpaid after the required due date.

You are responsible for all taxes on all payments required to be made by you under this Agreement (other than taxes that Fellowary is obligated to pay on its income, which are Fellowary’s responsibility). If you are required by a government agency to reduce your payment to Fellowary for any reason, you are required to provide sufficient documentation to Fellowary supporting the withholding. For questions about withholding taxes or taxes in general, please contact info@fellowary.com.

Except to the extent required by law, all payments, fees and royalties are non-refundable under all circumstances.

7. Records and Audits

You agree to keep accurate books and records related to your development, manufacture, Distribution, and sale of Products and related revenue. Fellowary may conduct reasonable audits of those books and records. Audits will be conducted during business hours on reasonable prior notice to you. Fellowary will bear the costs of audits unless the results show a shortfall in payments in excess of 5% during the period audited, in which case you will be responsible for the cost of the audit.

8. Support

Fellowary does not have any support obligations with respect to the Licensed Technology under this Agreement. Support resources may be obtained by checking on Fellowary's public github.

9. Feedback and Contributions

If you provide Fellowary with any Feedback, Fellowary is free to use the Feedback however it chooses. If you make any Contribution available to Fellowary, you hereby assign to Fellowary all right, title, and interest (including all copyright, patent, and other intellectual property rights) in that Contribution for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country. If any of those rights are not effectively assigned under applicable law, you hereby grant Fellowary a non-exclusive, fully-paid, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, make, use, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, modify and make derivative works based on, and otherwise exploit that Contribution for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country. If any of those rights may not be assigned or licensed under applicable law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby waive and agree not to assert all of those rights. However, you may continue to freely use any Feedback that you provide to Fellowary, and you may continue to use, in any manner consistent with the License, any Contribution that you make available to Fellowary.

You understand and agree that Fellowary is not required to make any use of any Feedback or Contribution that you provide. You agree that if Fellowary makes use of your Feedback or Contribution, Fellowary is not required to credit or compensate you for your contribution.

You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights in any Feedback or Contribution that you provide to Fellowary to grant Fellowary and other affected parties the rights described above. This includes but is not limited to intellectual property rights and other proprietary or personal rights.

10. Third Party Software

The Platform Code includes Third Party Software components. If Third Party Software has separate software license or attribution requirements, the license terms or other attribution requirements for Third Party Software components can be found in the installation directory of each Third Party Software's directory for each platform version. By entering into this Agreement and using Third Party Software, you are accepting the terms of those licenses. In this case, the Third Party Software terms will govern your use of the Third Party Software, and if there is inconsistency, those terms will take precedence over the terms of the License for the Third Party Software. You agree that the owners of the Third Party Software are intended third party beneficiaries to this Agreement in relation to your uses of Third Party Software.

11. Ownership

Fellowary or its licensors own all title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in the Platform Code and Content. You own all rights in the Products you develop under the License, other than the Platform Code and Content, Third Party Software, and any Contributions. All rights granted to you under this Agreement are granted by the Fellowary Licenses only and not by sale, and all of those rights are limited by and subject to the terms of this Agreement. No license or other rights will be created hereunder by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. Any attempted sublicense under this Agreement that is not consistent with the terms of this Agreement will be null and void.

12. Proprietary Notices and Attribution

You agree to retain and reproduce in all copies of the Licensed Technology the copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Fellowary and third parties as they appear in the Platform Code and the Content.

You agree to place the following notices in the credits (replacing xxxx with the current year) for any Product, to the extent such product has credits:

“[Product name] uses the Fellowary® Platform. Fellowary® is a trademark or registered trademark of Fellowary, Inc. in the United States of America and elsewhere”

“Fellowary® Platform, Copyright 2021 – xxxx, Fellowary, Inc. All rights reserved.”

No other license or right in the Fellowary Trademarks is granted under this Agreement. All use of the Fellowary Trademarks will inure to the sole benefit of Fellowary. You agree not to engage in any activity that could tarnish, dilute, or affect the validity or enforceability of the Fellowary Trademarks or cause consumer confusion or diminish any goodwill relating to any Fellowary Trademarks. If you wish to make further use of the Fellowary Trademarks, please email info@fellowary.com.

Fellowary may use your trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos used with any Product, as well as publicly released screen shots and video content from the Product, in connection with Fellowary’s marketing, advertisement, and promotion of the Fellowary Platform in any and all media without restriction.


13. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

The Licensed Technology and all other materials and information provided by Fellowary (the “Fellowary Materials”) are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, “with all faults” and without warranty of any kind. Fellowary, its licensors, and its and their affiliates disclaim all warranties, conditions, common law duties, and representations (express, implied, oral, and written) with respect to the Fellowary Materials, including without limitation all express, implied, and statutory warranties and conditions of any kind, such as title, non-interference with your enjoyment, authority, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness or suitability for any purpose (whether or not Fellowary knows or has reason to know of that purpose), system integration, accuracy or completeness, results, reasonable care, workmanlike effort, lack of negligence, and lack of viruses, whether alleged to arise under law, by reason of custom or usage in the trade, or by course of dealing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Fellowary, its licensors, and its and their affiliates make no warranty that (1) any of the Fellowary Materials will operate properly, including as integrated in any Product, (2) that the Fellowary Materials will meet your requirements, (3) that the operation of the Fellowary Materials will be uninterrupted, bug free, or error free in any or all circumstances, (4) that any defects in the Fellowary Materials can or will be corrected, (5) that the Fellowary Materials are or will be in compliance with a platform manufacturer’s rules or requirements, or (6) that a platform manufacturer will approve any of your Products, or will not revoke approval of any Product for any or no reason. Any warranty against infringement that may be provided in Section 2-312 of the Uniform Commercial Code or in any other comparable statute is expressly disclaimed. Fellowary, its licensors, and its and their affiliates do not guarantee continuous, error-free, virus-free, or secure operation of or access to the Fellowary Materials. This paragraph will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Fellowary, its licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Fellowary’s service providers, shall be liable in any way for loss or damage of any kind resulting from the use or inability to use the Fellowary Materials or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. In no event will Fellowary, its licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Fellowary’s service providers be liable for any loss of profits or any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, or any other damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Fellowary Materials, or the delay or inability to use or lack of functionality of the Fellowary Materials, even in the event of Fellowary’s or its affiliates’ fault, tort (including negligence), strict liability, indemnity, product liability, breach of contract, breach of warranty, or otherwise and even if Fellowary or its affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in those states or jurisdictions, the foregoing limitations of liability shall apply only to the full extent permitted by law.

14. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify, pay the defense costs of, and hold Fellowary, its licensors, its and their affiliates, and its and their employees, officers, directors, agents, contractors, and other representatives harmless from all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees, costs, and expert witnesses’ fees) that arise from or in connection with (a) any claim that, if true, would constitute a breach by you of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any Distribution or sublicensing of the Licensed Technology in violation of this Agreement) or negligence by you, (b) any claim brought by any third party to whom you Distribute or sublicense the Licensed Technology in violation of this Agreement (including without limitation any claim that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent), (c) any claim that any Product or any other matter you created, or your exercise of the Fellowary Licenses, infringes any third party’s intellectual property rights or other proprietary or personal rights (except to the extent of any claim that your authorized use of unmodified Platform Code or Content originally provided to you by Fellowary under this Agreement infringes any United States patent, trademark or copyright), or (d) any federal, state, or foreign civil or criminal actions related to any Product.

The Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this Agreement.

17. Class Action Waiver

You agree not to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action, or collective arbitration related to the Licensed Technology or this Agreement.

19. Independent Contractor

You and Fellowary are independent contractors and are not the legal representative, agent, joint venturer, partner, or employee of the other. Neither party has any right or authority to assume or create any obligations of any kind or to make any representation or warranty on behalf of the other party.

20. Amendments of this Agreement

Fellowary may issue an amended Agreement at any time in its discretion. You are not required to accept the amended Agreement.

If you do not accept the amended Agreement, you may not download or use existing Content or additional Content, or download or use any old Version or new Version that is made available by Fellowary contemporaneously with or after the issuance of that amended Agreement (this will terminate your License for the Licensed Technology that you downloaded prior to the issuance of the amended Agreement 120 days after the amended Agreement most recently issued by Fellowary). If you are a legal entity, acceptance of an amended Agreement by any of your Users will be binding on you.

21. Notices

22. No Assignment

You may not, without the prior written consent of Fellowary, assign, transfer, charge, or sub-contract all or any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement, and any attempt without that consent will be null and void.
